In fruit flip the goal is to match three or more colors in a row. This happens
by choosing the direction to which the player wants to switch the fruit with.
Then the player must click a fruit on board. Chosen fruit will switch places
with the fruit next to it to the chosen direction. If no matches are made with
that move the boxes will switch places again to their original positions. If
matches of three or more are made the boxes will not return to their previous
positions. This time they will stay and the fruits that made the match are
removed. All fruits above the removed fruits fall down as far as they can.
Deleting a fruit will give the player one point that will be shown under the
point marker.


RESET button

With this button the player can reset the board completely without closing the
window first. It will delete all fruits on the board and replace them with new
fruits. Points and time will reset also.


QUIT button

Window can be closed with quit button.


Direction buttons:
UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT

Direction buttons are pressed to choose in which direction the next fruit
pressed will switch positions with. This will be disabled when software is
deleting or dropping fruits.


FRUITS

Pressing the fruits will result in chosen fruit and the fruit next to it
in the chosen direction switching places. This will be disabled when software is
deleting or dropping fruits.


TIME

The game tracks time it has taken to play an individual game.


POINTS

The game tracks points that are shown in an LCD label.


REFILL

The player can choose to refill the board. When REFILL is checked after
dropping fruits empty spaces will be filled.



STRUCTURE

The algorithm to has been implemented in one function. It will search for
matches and store the fruits in an attribute container. Deleting and dropping
fruits are in their own functions.

Pressing the fruits has been done by getting the position of the cursos in the
event of pressing mouse instead of using buttons. Cursor position is then
calculated into indexes to find the fruit from the container.

Getting matches are not limited to three but as many as the player can get in a
row. L-shape of five fruits for example is possible also as long as the fruits
make matches of at least three in each direction.
